    alter last week's big5 program so that it does everything it did last week, and in addition:
    00. reads in the questions from the five question files, and stores them in five different lists
    01. reads in and stores the scoring information from the same files
        (e.g., what questions are positive, and what questions are negative
    02. use the stored scoring information to calculate the updated score after each question is asked
    03. uses a while loop to ensure that numbers between 00-05 are the only valid responses
    05. prints the scores out in two rows and five columns, with at least 05 spaces between each columns,
        and with the score centered under the label, like this:
        openness     conscientiousness     extroversion     agreeableness     neuroticism
           20               20                  08                 05                11
