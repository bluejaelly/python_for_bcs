# Last week, you wrote a program where each question was stored in a different variable.
# This week, write a program that
#       - stores the questions in a question_list.
#       - prints the instructions
#       - has a for loop that iterates over the list, each time through the loop
#           - asks the question
#           - saves the response to an answer_list
#           - also updates their final_score
#       - once the loop is done, the program should print out their final extroversion score
