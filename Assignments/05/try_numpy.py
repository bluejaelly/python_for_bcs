'''
    there are many libraries we might want that are not a part of the standard library.
    Two of them are numpy (for matrix algebra and all around faster math and data processing.
    To use libraries that are not a part of the standard library, first you need to get
    them. At the command window, type:
        python -m pip install numpy

    NOTE: Make sure that you type the lines above like you are running a normal python program. So if you normally type
    python3, then type: python3 -m pip install numpy.

    This should install these libraries for you. You might already have them (some installations of python do come
    with these because they are so popular. If so, you'll get a message saying "Requirement already satisfied".

    numpy does basic, high performance number crunching, especially for data in vector or matrix form. In numpy
    we call these data structures arrays.
    
    as always, first we have to import the library we want to use. You may note that the import statement is a little 
    different here. that "as np" part of it is just letting us refer to numpy using the shorter np instead of having to 
    type out numpy every time. We can do this anytime we import a library, giving it a special name will have in our 
    program. Usually this only happens with long library names that we want to shorten.
