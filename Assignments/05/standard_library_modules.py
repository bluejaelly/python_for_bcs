'''
Sometimes so far we have been dealing with the core python language, which provides basic data types and functions,
like strings, numbers, lists, so on. Over time, python has been extended to provide more functions that you can call
to do stuff, so that you dont have to write them yourself.

Some of these things (like calculating means and stuff) I have been making you write yourself, to give you practice
with core python functionality, because you will always have things you need to write yourself, and it is important
that you know how. But when you develop your own programs, you will very frequently make use of built in functions to
save yourself time. There is no reason to code your own function if it already exists (usually... sometimes otber
people's functions are coded in less optimal ways for time or space).

When it comes to using functions other people have written, we can distinguish between the "Standard Library" and
everything else. The standard library refers to all the modules that come with python, and so you already have them
on your computer, you just need to import them to use them. We have already done this with the "os" module and the
"sys" modules.

There is a lot of power in the standard library of modules, and a lot of things you might not even realize you can do
(or would want to do) until you browse through it. You can do that here (though I wouldn't suggest doing it now):

    We say "pseudo" because it is actually impossible to generate truly random numbers (well, except perhaps without
    using quantum physics). Any algorithm we would use to generate the numbers will be deterministic by definition,
    and so pure randomness isnt possible. So when you want a "random" number, python gets the current system time out
    to a pretty extreme decimal point, and then performs an algorithmic transformation of that to give you back a number
    that is pretty darn close to random, assuming you arent performing it on a regular basis every 0.000000001 seconds.
