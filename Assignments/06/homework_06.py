    #   00) Add a function to the human called "ask_question", that prints out a random question from a list of questions
    #   that you have hard-coded into the class.
    #   01) Add a function called "answer_question" that randomly print 'yes' or 'no', to a question that the function
    #       takes as an input parameter.
    #   02) in the main function, create two instances of the human class
    #   03) create a loop that cycles 10 times, each time through the loop the program should:
    #       - pause for 10 seconds (consult the documentation for the time module on how to do this...
    #       - randomly choose one of the humans to ask a question
    #       - have the other agent answer the question using it's answer_question function
